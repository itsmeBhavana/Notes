- Everything in JS happens in Execution Context
  
  ## Execution Context
  - Execution context is like a big box and it has 2 components in it.
    - Memory Component|Variable Environment: This is a place where all teh variables and functions are stored as key-value pairs.
    - Code Component|Thread of Execution: This is the place where code is executed one line at a time. It is like a thread that is executed one line at a time.
  
## JS is a Synchronous Single Threaded language - It executes one line at a time in a specific order.
  - Single Threaded: JS can execute only one command at a time.
  - Synchronous: JS executes in a specific order.
